# College-Id-Fine-Management
Built this Python app using Tkinter to handle college ID fines digitally. When students forget IDs, it tracks violations with increasing fines (₹50, ₹100, ₹150). Generates QR codes with secure tokens that expire in 10 minutes. Has admin dashboard for tracking payments and statistics. Simple GUI interface with auto receipts.
